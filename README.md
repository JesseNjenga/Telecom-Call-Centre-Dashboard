Securing the Telecom Connection: Every Customer Counts, Every Loss is Felt. Introducing a Proactive Approach to Customer Loyalty.
In the dynamic world of telecom, where customer loyalty is hard-earned, the retention and customer experience departments stand as the front line against contract terminations. Traditionally, reaching out to customers occurred after termination, but now, companies are shifting gears. They believe in foresight, not just reaction.
Enter a new era where we not only understand our customers but anticipate their needs. The journey began with customer analysis in Excel, but it led us to dead ends. Now, we're ready for a transformation. We're diving into the world of data visualization, seeking a clearer understanding of our customers that's not only insightful but self-explanatory for management.
This is more than a story - it's a strategic shift. Join us as we unveil the power of visualized data to fortify relationships and keep valued customers connected.
Creating a call center dashboard for a telecom company is essential for monitoring and improving customer service performance. Here are some main aspects and components you should consider incorporating into the dashboard, along with possible key performance indicators (KPIs): 
Key Metrics and KPIs: 

Total Calls: The total number of calls received in a given time period. Answered Calls: The number of calls that were answered by agents. Resolved Calls: The number of calls that were successfully resolved. Average Speed of Answer: The average time it takes for calls to be answered by agents.
Average Talk Duration: The average duration of calls. Satisfaction Rating: The average customer satisfaction rating is based on post-call surveys. 
2. Call Volume Trends: Use line charts or bar graphs to display call volume trends over time. This can help identify peak call times and seasonal variations in call volume.
 3. Agent Performance: Include visualizations to track individual agent performance. This can include metrics like the number of calls handled, average talk duration, and resolution rates. Highlight top-performing agents and identify agents who may require additional training or support.
 4. Call Resolution Time: Use a bar chart or histogram to show the distribution of call resolution times. This can help identify trends and outliers in call resolution efficiency. 
5. Speed of Answer: Display the average speed of answers over time to track how quickly calls are being answered by agents. 
6. Topic Analysis: Create a pie chart or bar chart to visualize the distribution of call topics or reasons for customer inquiries. This can help identify common issues. 
7. Customer Satisfaction: Display customer satisfaction ratings over time to monitor changes in customer sentiment and identify areas for improvement. 
8. Abandoned Calls: Track the number of calls that were abandoned by customers before being answered. High abandonment rates may indicate issues with call volume or response times.
 9. First Call Resolution (FCR): Calculate and display the percentage of calls that were resolved on the first call. FCR is a critical metric for measuring customer service efficiency. 
10. Call Queue Length: - Use a line chart or bar chart to show the length of the call queue over time. This can help managers allocate resources effectively during peak call times. 
11. SLA Compliance: - Monitor and display the percentage of calls that meet the company's service level agreement (SLA) in terms of speed of answer and resolution times. 
12. Agent Availability: - Show the availability of agents for handling calls. This can help managers allocate resources efficiently.
